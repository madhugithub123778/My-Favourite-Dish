        <p>I love this dish as it is so rich and authentic in flavour, with its spices and aromas. It is a North Indian dish so I don't get to eat it that much as I am a South Indian and I mainly eat Tamil food. So when I do get to eat it, its the best thing ever! It is a very filling and warm dish and it is my definite go-to at any North Indian restaurant. Naan is basically a chewy flatbread and can be stuffed with paneer, coriander and many others but my favourite is cheese. It is not a classic combination but I am not the most classic person when it comes to food so this is what I love eating. Naan can be eaten with vegetables, meat, fish and of course, dal. Dal Mahkni is basically black dal in a thick gravy made with butter (as Makhni means buttery) and other ingredients. Overall, it is rich and soulful. Compiling all these descriptions and reasons, Cheese Naan and Dal Makhni becomes one of my all-time favourite dishes.</p>
